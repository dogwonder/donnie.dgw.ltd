On 01-12-86 at about 3:43am I was circling the perimeter of the Clearview Juvenile Detention Center when I discovered a white male, dressed in prison clothing, asleep in the fetal position in a grass field approximately 30 yards from the nothern perimeter fence.On arrival to the location I noticed that the subject was regaining consciousness. His clothing was torn in several places and I could see several lacerations and bleeding from his hands, arms and legs. Clothing fragments were clearly visible in the barb wire at the top of the fencing, as it appeared to me that the suspect had climbed the fence without regard for personal injury.As I took the subject into custody, he was cooperative and apologetic. "I'm sorry," he said. "I am so sorry, I don't understand why this happens to me. I am so sorry." Subject claimed that he did not remember the escape attempt because of his problems with sleepwalking.C:\>more ? (y/n)
