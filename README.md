## Inspiration
I've always loved this website...
Ruffle.js...

## Ruffle.js Revival of the Game

### Playability Through the Internet Archive
- **Ruffle.js Integration:** The game has been made playable again through Ruffle.js. 
- **Internet Archive:** The game was [playable again](https://web.archive.org/web/20160303085928/http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/) after many years, thanks to its availability on the Internet Archive.
- **Archival Inconsistencies:** Unfortunately, the game often gets stuck after the initial menu or just after the first section. This varies depending on the site version or the specific archive capture accessed.
- **Dispersed Archives:** Many game pages are archived, but they are scattered across different parts of the archive, requiring direct access to certain pages to progress through the game.

### Resources and Digital Archaeology
- **Archived List of Pages and Files:** A comprehensive list of all the pages and files that were archived can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/*) and some from the [original site](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ww2.donniedarko.com/are/you/sleep/golfing/*).
- **Guide to the Site:** An archived [guide to the site](https://web.archive.org/web/20130106005533/http://ruinedeye.com/cd/aid2.htm) has been invaluable.
- **Creatorâ€™s Showcase:** Alexandra Jugovic, the site's creator, showcases the original site and much user journey on her [website reel](https://alexandrajugovic.com/donniedarko).
- **Building a Sitemap:** Utilizing these resources, along with 404 errors indicated in the console and network tab, helped in constructing a sitemap of the original site.

### Reconstruction and Archival Layers
- **Multi-Layered Archive:** The current version is an archive of an archive of an archive, originating from donniedarko.com and later archive.hi-res.net.
- **Lost Elements:** Unfortunately, some parts, particularly a few SWF files, were lost over time. These include files from Level 2 (`street.swf`, `love.swf`, `fear.swf`) and Level 3 (`lamp.swf`, `phone.swf`).
- **Reconstruction Efforts:** These missing parts have been reconstructed in HTML, guided by the archived guide website, the website reel, and discussions on Reddit about the site's content.

### Community Contributions
- **Reddit Insights:** Reddit discussions provided valuable insights and interpretations of the site's text, contributing significantly to the reconstruction process.

## Missing parts and notes

#### Desktop Recommended for Optimal Experience
- **Keyboard Input:** This application is best experienced on a desktop due to its reliance on keyboard input.
- **Navigation Note:** Occasionally, new tabs may not function properly. If this occurs, it's recommended to return to the [main menu](menu.html) and restart the process. Or make sure only one tab is open. 

#### Content Reconstruction Updates:
- **Missing Sections:** Some sections have been reconstructed in HTML/CSS/JavaScript to replace missing SWF files. The application now redirects to alternative content when attempting to access these files.
  - For instance, when `/are/you/sleep/golfing/love.swf` is requested, it will now redirect to `/are/you/sleep/golfing/missing/intro.html`.

#### Specific Level Updates:
- **Level 2 - Second Part:**
  - *Status:* The original SWF files for this section were not retrievable.
  - *Solution:* A reconstructed version has been implemented.
  - *Navigation:* Upon completing this segment, the game should automatically progress to the new content. If it does not, please [click here](/are/you/sleep/golfing/missing/intro.html) to continue.

- **Level 3 - Second Part:**
  - *Status:* The original SWF files for this section were also unavailable.
  - *Solution:* This segment has been similarly rebuilt.
  - *Navigation:* After finishing this part of the game, [click here](/from/the/sky/transcript.html) to proceed.
