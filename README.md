5.html - Golf course 'Do you think he was sleepgolfing' click on donnie
6.html - animation of donnie waking up. click on white arrow. popup asks "who found the wallet?" enter ling ling / or not. (from what i can tell the screen leads to the same/next page automatically even if you don't enter the password).
7.html - sidewalk screen - ("i've been waiting for you"). click on o dot - a popup of donnie looking at jim's wallet appears. click inside popup.
8.html - red lines remain - click on the blinking red dot at the tip of the longest line. this leads to a popup article on Cunning Visions. ..... go to next section
