Inspiration...
I've always loved this website...
Ruffle.js

Process....

Ruffle.js means the game is playable again. And as the Internet Archive has it enabled for old flash sites it was [playable again](https://web.archive.org/web/20160303085928/http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/) after many years! The problem is not all of it appears to have been archvied so the game gets stuck after the initial menu, or just after the first section depening on where you land on the site or indeed what capture you land on. Although many of the pages are still archived there are in different parts of the archive and require you to go directly to some pages to progress through the game. 

It was possible to at least see a list of all the pages and files that was [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/*) as well as some from the [original site](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ww2.donniedarko.com/are/you/sleep/golfing/*) and an archive of a [guide to the site](https://web.archive.org/web/20130106005533/http://ruinedeye.com/cd/aid2.htm)! Along with these bits of evidence the website from the creator of this very excellent site - [Alexandra Jugovic](https://alexandrajugovic.com/donniedarko)has a website reel showcasing the website and most of the user journey. Using all these bits of digital archeology it was possible to start to build up a sitemap of the original site. Additionally the console would inidcate 404s when a resource could not be found, and back to the archive again to see if it could be found at different snapshot points. As 

After managing to piece together via the Internet Archive, specifically the archive of the orignal site localed on donniedarko.com and laterly on archive.hi-res.net. So this is technically an archive of an archive of an archive or the original. 

There were some parts that were just sadely lost to time, specifical a few swf files that appears to be streams (I think). From Level 2, street.swf, love.swf and fear.swf, Level 3; lamp.swf and phone.swf. As such I had to reconstruct these in HTML based on the archvied guide website, and the Website reel. Reddit was also a good source to find some text on the site that people discussed the meaning of (thankfully)

Experience.....
