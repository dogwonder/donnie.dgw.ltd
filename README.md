## Easter eggs

1. Mailto on News popup, e.g. news/pop1.html (loads iseeyou.swf)

## Level 1 User Journey

1. **Initial Page Load**: 
   - Opens `intro.html`, which loads several swfs: `intro.swf`, `clouds.swf`, `book.swf`, and `menu.swf`.
   - Alternatively, `menu.html` can be loaded directly, which only loads `menu.swf`.

2. **News pop-up (Part 1)**: 
   - Pop-up is displayed - `news/pop1.html`, which in turn loads `news/newspaper4.htm` (loads `top.swf` & `side.swf`).
   - The section is closed the next part of the game is loaded.

3. **News pop-up (Part 2)**: 
   - Pop-up is displayed - `news/pop2.html`, which in turn loads `news/newspaper3.htm` (loads `top.swf` & `side.swf`).
   - Similar to the previous step, once closed the next part of the game is loaded.

4. **The Tangent Universe Is Unstable (Part 1)**:
   - Opens `the/tangent/index.html`, which loads `smurf.swf`.

5. **The Tangent Universe Is Unstable (Part 2)**:
   - Opens`the/tangent/universe/is_unstable.html, which loads `philosophy.swf`.
   - A series of SWFs are loaded in this order: `dad.swf`, `donnie.swf`, `straight.swf`, `gran-donnie.swf`.
   - Followed by `thebook.swf`.

## Level 2 User Journey

1. **Return to Menu**:
   - User opens `menu.html`, loading `menu.swf`, `clouds.swf`, and `book.swf`.

2. **Level 2 Pop Section**:
   - Pop-up is displayed `pop/pop_level2.html`, which loads `pass2.swf`.

3. **Closing the Pop Section**:
   - Loads `pop/close.html`.

4. **Golfing Experience**:
   - Redirects to `are/you/sleep/golfing/index.html`.
   - This page loads multiple SWFs: `golf.swf`, `birds.swf`, `draw.swf`.

5. **Exploring News Section (Part 3)**:
   - The user goes to `news/pop3.html` and then to `news/newspaper2.htm`.

6. **Missing Section**:
   - The SWF files `street.swf`, `love.swf` and `fear.swf` fails to load when this happens we listen for that network event and load up `are/you/sleep/golfing/missing/intro.html`
   - The reconstructed game progresses from `are/you/sleep/golfing/missing/1.html` to `are/you/sleep/golfing/missing/7.html`.
   - The journey includes a pop-up to `news/newspaper5.htm`.

7. **Sparkle Motion Section**:
   - Game progresses to `sparkle/motion/index.html`, which loads `phase2_end.swf`.

## Level 3 User Journey

1. **Revisiting Menu**:
   - User opens `menu.html` again, loading the same set of SWFs as before.

2. **Level 3 Pop Section**:
   - Pop-up is displayed `pop/pop_level3.html`, loading `pass3.swf`.

3. **Concluding the Pop Section**:
   - Visits `pop/close.html`.

4. **Sky-Themed Exploration**:
   - Redirects to `from/the/sky/index.html`, which loads `trampolin.swf`.

5. **Pop-up warning**:
   - Pop-up is displayed `news/pop6.html`.

6. **Final Missing Section**:
   - The SWF files `lamp.swf` and `phone.swf` fail to load, once `phone.swf` fails we redirect to reconstructed page `from/the/sky/transcript.html`
   - End of the game

## Inspiration
I've always loved this website...
Ruffle.js...

## Ruffle.js Revival of the Game

### Playability Through the Internet Archive
- **Ruffle.js Integration:** The game has been made playable again through Ruffle.js. 
- **Internet Archive:** The game was [playable again](https://web.archive.org/web/20160303085928/http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/) after many years, thanks to its availability on the Internet Archive.
- **Archival Inconsistencies:** Unfortunately, the game often gets stuck after the initial menu or just after the first section. This varies depending on the site version or the specific archive capture accessed.
- **Dispersed Archives:** Many game pages are archived, but they are scattered across different parts of the archive, requiring direct access to certain pages to progress through the game.

### Resources and Digital Archaeology
- **Archived List of Pages and Files:** A comprehensive list of all the pages and files that were archived can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/*) and some from the [original site](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ww2.donniedarko.com/are/you/sleep/golfing/*).
- **Guide to the Site:** An archived [guide to the site](https://web.archive.org/web/20130106005533/http://ruinedeye.com/cd/aid2.htm) has been invaluable.
- **Creatorâ€™s Showcase:** Alexandra Jugovic, the site's creator, showcases the original site and much user journey on her [website reel](https://alexandrajugovic.com/donniedarko).
- **Building a Sitemap:** Utilizing these resources, along with 404 errors indicated in the console and network tab, helped in constructing a sitemap of the original site.

### Reconstruction and Archival Layers
- **Multi-Layered Archive:** The current version is an archive of an archive of an archive, originating from donniedarko.com and later archive.hi-res.net.
- **Lost Elements:** Unfortunately, some parts, particularly a few SWF files, were lost over time. These include files from Level 2 (`street.swf`, `love.swf`, `fear.swf`) and Level 3 (`lamp.swf`, `phone.swf`).
- **Reconstruction Efforts:** These missing parts have been reconstructed in HTML, guided by the archived guide website, the website reel, and discussions on Reddit about the site's content.

### Community Contributions
- **Reddit Insights:** Reddit discussions provided valuable insights and interpretations of the site's text, contributing significantly to the reconstruction process.

## Missing parts and notes

#### Desktop Recommended for Optimal Experience
- **Keyboard Input:** This application is best experienced on a desktop due to its reliance on keyboard input.
- **Navigation Note:** Occasionally, new tabs may not function properly. If this occurs, it's recommended to return to the [main menu](menu.html) and restart the process. Or make sure only one tab is open. 

#### Content Reconstruction Updates:
- **Missing Sections:** Some sections have been reconstructed in HTML/CSS/JavaScript to replace missing SWF files. The application now redirects to alternative content when attempting to access these files.
  - For instance, when `/are/you/sleep/golfing/love.swf` is requested, it will now redirect to `/are/you/sleep/golfing/missing/intro.html`.

#### Specific Level Updates:
- **Level 2 - Second Part:**
  - *Status:* The original SWF files for this section were not retrievable.
  - *Solution:* A reconstructed version has been implemented.
  - *Navigation:* Upon completing this segment, the game should automatically progress to the new content. If it does not, please [click here](/are/you/sleep/golfing/missing/intro.html) to continue.

- **Level 3 - Second Part:**
  - *Status:* The original SWF files for this section were also unavailable.
  - *Solution:* This segment has been similarly rebuilt.
  - *Navigation:* After finishing this part of the game, [click here](/from/the/sky/transcript.html) to proceed.
