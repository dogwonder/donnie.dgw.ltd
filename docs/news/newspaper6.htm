                          Today is the three year anniversary of the events that occured 
                          on October 2, 1988<br>
                          <br>
                          Engine X came falling from the sky, killing a young man. His 
                          name, Darko, now part of our local legend, continues to be 
                          the subject of endless speculation. <br>
                          <br>
                          His family has moved west to California. They did not return 
                          this reporter's calls. This I understand, as the mystery of 
                          that night must weigh so much more in their hearts and minds 
                          than it does in ours.<br>
                          <br>
                          Attempts to retrieve information from the Federal Aviation 
                          Administration have become futile, as their spokesperson simply 
                          releases the same statement. <br>
                          "The investigation is ongoing," he says. </p>
                        <p><br>
                          Rumors that President Bush has visited the secret wherehouse 
                          in Washington that stores the engine have been the latest 
                          to surface, and once again nothing can be confirmed.</p>
                        <p>We are told of a vast conspiracy, of a plane that they know 
                          exists. We are told of flight trajectories, serial numbers, 
                          and low impact velocity. The technical jargon is endless and 
                          fascinating. Yet there is no evidence. There is nothing but 
                          Engine X, an artifact from that night.</p>
                        <p> <br>
                          A bomb that fell upon our quiet community has left behind 
                          so many questions that we must now accept that there will 
                          never be answers. </p>
